# Programming Tutor Note
By **Yadong (Adam) Liu**

(updated 3.Nov.2021)

Thank you for those who attended the meeting last Friday. I wasn't feeling well that day & think I didn't explain everything well. So I think it's better to note key points down in this file so you all will know what is happening.

* The programming tutor is set to help student with their programming issues during the term.

### Notice

* **Because MS teams is not convient in orgainization. Hence the group will be moved into a discord channel with another programming tutor & tutees (However, I'm still your programming tutor, more see the <mark>Dicord</mark> section below)**

The meeting is scheduled every week, time as follow:

**The meeting will be hold via Zoom**

* Meeting Time (24h-format)
	- **18:00** to **19:00** every **Wedenesday**
	- **10:00** to **11:00** every **Friday** 

#### During meeting

* If there's any question raised, we try to solve them in the class.
	If the question can't be solved in the class, I will note it down and try my best to solve it after meeting & note the answer in pdf.
	
* If no one has question or issue, I can do some extra stuff. In this case, I will give serval topics for yours to decide(vote) before our meeting.

#### After meeting

* For people that attend the meeting everyweek, there's a survey that for giving feedback.

#### Discord channel

* I have discussed with another programming tutor that both our groups can be merged in one discord channel & the resources can be shared among our groups. Which  I think it is great.

Please join the discrod channel after reading this pdf.  :)

## Something useful for Term1

* Below are some of the useful resources which I found useful in my Y1.

### COMP00147 (Discrete Math)
* Discrete Math Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyDKR4FG3Yw&list=PLDDGPdw7e6Ag1EIznZ-m-qXu4XX3A0cIz
(Some part is helpful for understanding content of 147)

* COMP0147 Note made by previous UCL CS student:
Git repo : https://github.com/jieyouxu/COMP0147-Discrete-Mathematics-Notes

(PDF release: https://github.com/jieyouxu/COMP0147-Discrete-Mathematics-Notes/releases)

### COMP0002 (C & Haskell)

* C:
	- https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/  ------- For syntax of C
	- Book: **Head First C** ------- Not deeply into the syntax, but the book gives you a border view on features of C
	- Video Resource: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-essential-training?u=69919578

* Haskell:
	- http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters ----- Book for learning feature & syntax of Haskell. (I think only first half of the book is required in the module)
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgu82wiiZ90&list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV ----- Covers simillar stuff to the book but in videos.

### ENGF0002

* Python:
	- https://www.w3schools.com/python/ ------- For syntax of Python
	- Object-Oriented Design: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-object-oriented-design-3?u=69919578 (You will have this module in term2, but I remember some of the concept was used in this module. Hence I think this might be helpful)

### ENGF0001

* Arduino:
	- Book: Getting started with Arduino
	- Arduino Language Reference:  https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/ 

## Other general resources

* Coursera (Online learning resource)
* W3schools (Learning syntax of a language)
* Linkedin learning (Online learning platform, free for UCL students)
* Leetcode (An online platform to practice algorithm)
* Videos about Git (A tool that is really commonly used in team work) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-git/
